<h2> PREFACE </h2>
	 <p>I had just joined the FCR friend-group in 2020 and was immediately injected with bfdi culture. Never saw the series before, and i'm not sure whether i saw Epic's YAG or BFDI first. <br />
	 This was my thinly veiled attempt at saying "can i work for one of you?". Working with Epic on YAG was my first idea, because she liked this rewrite a bunch when I presented it. <br />
	 Unfortunately I didn't have the gut to say it outright, so Fristo gladly swept me away into Media Battle, and i'm very happy with how it went! <br />

	<div class ="bg">
	<h2> AFTERTHOUGHTS </h2>
	 <p> So yeah, this is what I thought object shows should be after seeing one. There's many holes here, but I can at least say it's entertaining. My idea was to seperate the teams into ideas. <br />
	 TEAM GAMMA would be the quick and funny one, TEAM 2 would be the character interacting-middle of the road one, and TEAM A were the fun wacky ones. Every character is having fun in a way or another.<br />
	 This also led to my idea of choosing the funnest team to be the one up for elimination, for a harder vote. This was the beginning of a lot of tropes for myself, which includes the random animal worldbuilding. <br />
	 I find natural worldbuilding like this interesting (as a fan of Yoyle Berries) and i wish they did that more! Although media battle was done a bit after this, it's much more professional. Thanks for watching!
